# Introduction
This repo is a list of notes and projects I wrote while taking Udacity's "Data Engineering Nanodegree" course in Summer 2022.

# Update: August 2023
I started this Nanodegree a little more than a year ago - in late June 2022. I worked on it up until October, 2022 at which point I paused working on it for personal reasons.
Now - about 10 months later - I was ready to finish the degree finally, and I've found that it's been rewritten (probably for the best - the version I did had some seriously outdated code & projects).
Due to that, I am archiving this project. There is good code and concepts here about AWS, Cassandra, Postgres, Airflow, Spark, and some other assorted tools that I can use in future projects as needed.
I will instead enroll in a new program with Udacity (either AWS or Azure Data Engineering) and finally the new course.
