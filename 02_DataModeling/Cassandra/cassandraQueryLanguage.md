# Cassandra Query Language (CQL)
- CQL is very similar to SQL, the biggest exception being that CQL does **not** support JOINS, GROUP BY, or subqueries.
- CQL query 'driving' (compilation?) requires custom code. There are CQL interpreters, and additionally Node.js, Python, and Java have built-in drivers (and possibly other languages)
