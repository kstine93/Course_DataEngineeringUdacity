_Udacity - Data Engineering Nanodegree_

## Introduction to Cloud Computing
It's a scalable network of servers to manage and process data.

- Eliminates need to invest in hardware
- Allows scalability
- Allows remote access natively

## Introduction to AWS
- Currently (2022) offers >140 services across computing, storage, event buses, databases, permissions, etc.
- Accessible via:
  - dedicated CLI
  - Web UI console
  - Software development kits (SDKs)
    - **Note: SDKs provide tools, libraries, documentation, examples, etc. to form the basis of new application development**

Note: The "AWS Toolkit" in VS code is an SDK to connect and interact with AWS services.
  
### AWS Costs
- Leaving services running on AWS (even unused ones) incurs costs. **Be careful about turning AWS services off - don't leave AWS without doing this.**
