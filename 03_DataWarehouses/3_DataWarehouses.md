## Introduction to Data Warehouses

### What is a data warehouse?
#### Business Perspective
- Customers should be able to find goods and make orders
- Staff should be able to stock and re-order goods
- Delivery staff should be able to find and deliver goods
- HR should have an overview of staff
- Management should be able to see sales growth
- etc.

**Operational Processes**
- e.g., find goods, make orders, deliver goods

These are typically *online transactional processing* databases (OLTP) and often 3rd normal form

**Analytical Processes**
- e.g., Assess sales staff performance, measure growth

These are typically *online analytical processing* databases (OLAP) and de-normalized

---
Except for very small databases, it's not a good idea to use the SAME data structures for analytical and operational tasks - so we will need to create different (but complementary) structures to support these different needs of the business. **This is where a data warehouse comes into play**

> **A data warehouse is a system which retrieves and consolidates data from source systems (operational processes) for the purpose of enabling analysis**

### Recap of dimensional modeling
Third normal form databases are optimized for consistency (rather than speed). For OLTP purposes, this is fine (or even preferable), but for OLAP purposes, we will want to use a de-normalized form, such as a fact & dimension tables.
- **Fact Tables** record business **events**, such as orders, phone calls - stuff that typically symbolizes the relationship between data
- **Dimension Tables** reocrd business **attributes** like individual stores, customers, products, and employees.

However, sometimes it's not always clear what is a *fact* and what is a *dimension*. A simple rule of thumb is **facts are usually numeric and additive**.
For example:
- a review on an article is technically an event, but we can't easily make statistics out of its text content (not a good 'fact')
- invoice numbers might be numeric, but they're not additive (not a good 'fact')
- invoice amount is both numeric and additive (would be a good fact)

Also:
- Date & time are always dimensions
- Physical locations and their attributes are good dimensions candidates
- Products are almost always dimensions

#### Moving from 3rd normal form to fact & dimension tables:
Here's an example from the Udacity course of how you could take a 3NF database and transform it into a de-normalized fact & dimension setup:

### Data warehousing (DWH) architecture
There have been different proposed architectures for data warehouses which have tried to optimize for different things.

#### Kimball's Bus Architecture

Kimball's Bus Architecture:
- Separates ETL and source transactions (source data) entirely from the presentation of data ("back room" vs. "front room")
- Final data always contains data on the most basic atomic level (i.e., not aggregated) although extra aggregations may also exist.
- Data should be organized according to business processes or departments (focus on end user for data organization)
- Uses "**conformed dimensions**" - across all views and tables, if any dimensions can be used in a standardized way (e.g., date), then all views and tables **use the same** dimension table.
- Design Goals:
  - Ease of use
  - Query performance

Designing a Kimball's Bus can be facilitated by making a simple table of which business units require which dimension tables. It's then possible to see the overlap in needs and therefore whether it's possible to standardize any dimension tables.

#### Independent Data Marts

Independent Data Marts:
- Often occurs as an ad hoc (unplanned) system
- Still has a 'front room' and a 'back room' like Kimball's bus, but **each department designs its own separate ETL processes for its own data needs**
- Has therefore no conformity between views generated by different departments; can lead to inconsistency
- This model is generally discouraged due to inefficiencies (each ETL by each department is repeating work) and inconsistency.
- This model does however reduce the overhead of coordination and centralized ETL.
